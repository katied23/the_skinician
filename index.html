        <h1>Welcome to The Skinician!</h1>
        <p>In this evergrowing skincare industry, products seem endless and at times, very confusing.<br>
            Each skincare product is designed to target a specific skin type or skin issues, using the incorrect
            products
            for your skin can actually trigger or worsen the condition of your skin, yet it extremely common!<br>
            With this in mind, The Skinician aims to teach you the basics of skincare to suit your own skin whilst
            weeding out some
            products that are just unnecessary.<br>
            Our Skin Quiz will advise you of your skin type along with the basic products you need to start your
            skincare journey. Investing in your
            skin can be expensive, with that in mind your results will offer you a highend brand product along with a
            drugstore alternative. There are so many
            products available on the market so bear in mind, product recommendations are a guideline but you will be
            aware of what you need to search for in terms
            of products to get for your own skin needs. </p>
